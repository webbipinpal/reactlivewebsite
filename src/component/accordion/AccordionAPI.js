        question: 'What are the features of React?',
        answer: 'React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.'

    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: 'What is JSX?',
        answer: 'JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.'

    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: 'Can web browsers read JSX directly? ',
        answer: 'Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object '

    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: 'What is the virtual DOM?',
        answer: 'DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.'

    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: 'Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?',
        answer: 'Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it provides less coding and provides more functionality, whereas, with JavaScript applications, code tends to get complex very quickly.'

    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: 'What is the difference between the ES6 and ES5 standards?',
        answer: 'This is one of the most frequently asked react interview questions. These are the few instances where ES6 syntax has changed from ES5 syntax:'

        id: 7,
        question: 'How do you create a React app?',
        answer: 'These are the steps for creating a React app: Install NodeJS on the computer because we need npm to install the React library. Npm is the node package manager that contains many JavaScript libraries, including React.'

    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: 'What is an event in React?',
        answer: 'An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML. With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.'

    },
    {
        id: 9,
        question: 'How do you create an event in React?',
        answer: 'A React event can be created by doing the following:'

        id: 10,
        question: 'What are synthetic events in React?',
        answer: 'Synthetic events combine the response of different browser`s native events into one API, ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.'
